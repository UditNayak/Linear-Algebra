## Linear Algebra Applications
1. Data Analysis and Big data
   - Understanding the large piles of data using Machine Learning Models by the help of vector representations and operations.
2. Computer Graphics
   - The idea of computer graphics is to have an image that you can move around on the screen.
   - Translations and rotations in three dimensions can be implemented by multiplying the coordinates of the image by this three by three matrix ( Matrix Transformation ).
   - This is called a rotation matrix, and it's a really compact way and an efficient way to manipulate the location and the perspective of pictures on the screen.
   - Actually, many modern computer graphics applications and algorithms rely on something called quaternions, which are vectors containing four dimensional complex numbers. Now, these quaternions are a little bit more computationally efficient, but the principle is exactly the same as this kind of translation and rotation matrix.
3. Graph Theory
   - graph theory is a mathematical framework that is used to understand networks.
   - Graph theory is crucial to a wide range of topics, including air traffic control, the Internet, social media networks and even the brain.
   - Many problems in graph theory can be solved by using matrices to represent the information in the graphs of the nodes and all the connectivities across the different nodes.
4. Linear algebra is a prerequisite for multivariate calculus and differential equations.
5. Linear algebra is also the key backbone, the computational workforce that underlies many modern algorithms in big data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics.
   - Therefore, linear algebra will help you improve your programming skills while also learning about modern algorithms and modern data science.
